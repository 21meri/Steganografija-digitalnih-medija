Digital Media Steganography in Python

This repository contains 17 Python projects focused on steganography â€” the art of hiding information within digital media. The projects demonstrate how to conceal text, images, audio, and video within other media files using various techniques.

Project Structure

Each folder contains code that demonstrates a specific steganographic method:

1. Hide message in image - LSB  
2. Hide image in image  
3. Hide text document in image  
4. Hide audio in image  
5. Hide video in image  
6. Hide GIF in image  
7. Hide message with encryption (like in an app)  
8. Hide message in image - DCT  
9. Hide image in image - DWT  
10. Hide message in audio - method 1  
11. Hide message in audio - method 2  
12. Hide message in audio - method 3  
13. Hide message in GIF  
14. Hide image in GIF  
15. Hide audio in GIF  
16. Hide GIF in GIF  
17. Hide message in video  

Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- Libraries such as: numpy, opencv-python, pydub, wave, scipy, cryptography, matplotlib, moviepy, and others depending on the project

 How to Run

To run any of the steganography projects, 
1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/steganography-python-projects.git`
2. Navigate into it with `cd steganography-python-projects`.
3. Enter the folder of the desired project, for example `cd "1 sakrivanje poruke u sliku-lsb"`.
4. Finally, run the script with `python main.py`.
Some projects may require additional input files like images, audio, or text, so refer to the comments in each script for details.
